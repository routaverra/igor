;; Full music example: arch-contour cantus firmus with florid
;; counterpoint, both voices satisfying a melodic contour DFA
;; ============================================================

;; Musical scenario:
;;
;; We simultaneously compose a cantus firmus and a florid (2:1)
;; counterpoint voice. Both voices are constrained to follow an
;; "arch" melodic contour — they must ascend before they descend,
;; and once descending begins, no more ascending. This is a
;; classical rule for well-shaped melodies.
;;
;; The CF contour is enforced via `regular` (DFA accepting
;; ascending-then-descending interval sequences).
;;
;; The CP contour is enforced via `cost_regular` with the same DFA
;; plus per-transition costs that penalize large leaps. The solver
;; minimizes the CP's total leap cost, naturally producing smooth,
;; conjunct (stepwise) melodic motion.
;;
;; Second-species counterpoint rules connect the two voices:
;; strong beats consonant, weak-beat dissonances are passing tones,
;; CP above CF, start/end on a perfect consonance.

;; ============================================================

;; Global constraints (regular, table, cost_regular) cannot be reified
;; in MiniZinc. The flattener prevents direct reification, but nesting
;; inside intermediate conjunctions used to cause indirect reification.
;; These tests verify the fix: nesting IInclude nodes inside (and ...)
;; should work identically to flat conjunctions.
